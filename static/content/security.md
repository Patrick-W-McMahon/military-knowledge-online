# Website Security and Data Use Policy

**Effective Date:** 2023/06/29

## Introduction:
This document outlines the security measures and data use policy of the MKO web application. At MKO, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users. This policy explains how we handle user data, the security measures we have in place, and our commitment to maintaining user confidentiality.

## Data Storage and Use:
1. **User Preferences:** The MKO web application stores user preferences locally in the user's browser cache. This means that all user-specific data, including preferences, settings, and other personalized information, is stored on the user's device and is not sent back to our server. We do not collect or store this data on our servers, ensuring that user preferences remain private and secure.

2. **Non-Tracking:** The MKO web application does not employ any user tracking mechanisms or analytics tools to monitor user usage or behavior. We do not collect or analyze any personal information or browsing history.

3. **Cookies:** The MKO web application may use cookies, which are small text files stored on the user's device, to enhance user experience and provide certain functionality. These cookies do not contain personal information and are used solely for technical purposes, such as session management or remembering user preferences within the application.

4. **Form Submission:** The MKO web application may include forms for user interaction. It is important to note that any data provided in these forms must not include Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or any data that is not categorized as unclassified. Users are responsible for ensuring that the information they submit through forms does not violate this policy.

## Security Measures:
1. **Encryption:** To ensure the security and privacy of user data during transmission, we employ industry-standard encryption protocols (such as HTTPS) for all data exchanged between the user's device and our servers.

2. **Server-side Data Protection:** While the MKO web application does not store user data on our servers, we maintain robust security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of our server infrastructure. These measures include regular security audits, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other appropriate safeguards.

3. **Data Breach Reporting:** MKO is committed to promptly reporting any data breaches or unauthorized access incidents to the relevant authorities. We will also inform the brigade of the source of the breach, enabling appropriate actions to be taken.

## SKIF and Data Classification:
1. The MKO web application follows all requirements to run in a Secure Knowledge and Information Fusion (SKIF) environment.

2. The MKO web application is authorized for only unclassified data. Other classifications and PII are not authorized on MKO.

## Conclusion:
At MKO, we prioritize the privacy and security of our users. The MKO web application employs local storage of user preferences, does not track user usage, and ensures the secure transmission of data. We maintain appropriate security measures to protect our servers and respond swiftly to any potential security incidents. By using the MKO web application, users agree to abide by this security and data use policy. If you have any questions or require further clarification, please contact our support team.

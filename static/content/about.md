Welcome to Military Knowledge Online https://www.militaryknowledgeonline.info. Your go to source for any Military links. While most (not ALL) links on this website link to Official U.S. Military/Government websites; it is not endorsed or maintained by the U.S. Military. Most official Military and U.S. Government websites are hosted on ".mil" and ".gov" domains. I am SPC McMahon Patrick, I develop, maintain, and run militaryknowledgeonline. This site is very much a work in progress as there are an oddly large amount of military websites and will likely change within the coming future as a result. For further information or questions on this please feel free to email them to patrick.w.mcmahon@gmail.com or patrick.w.mcmahon11.mil@army.mil. Please note while I do not respond to every email, I do read them. Always, thank you for supporting Military Knowledge Online.

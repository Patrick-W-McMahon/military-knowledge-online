## Cadet Creed

I am an Army Cadet.
Soon I will take an oath and become an Army Officer committed to defending the values, which make this nation great.
Honor is my touchstone. I understand mission first and people always.
I am the PAST: the spirit of those warriors who have made the final sacrifice.
I am the PRESENT: the scholar and apprentice soldier enhancing my skills in the science of warfare and the art of leadership.
But, above all, I am the FUTURE: the future warrior leader of the United States Army. May God give me the compassion and judgment to lead and the gallantry to WIN.

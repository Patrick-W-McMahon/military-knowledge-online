## The Sapper Creed

I am a Sapper, the cutting edge of my countryâ€™s sword.
I will always endeavor to complete my Sapper mission, regardless of available assets. My flexibility and special training shall provide my task force with a tool to overcome insurmountable odds.
I realize that I will be called upon for my expertise in all aspects of mobility, counter mobility, and survivability. The failure to effectively accomplish my mission could cost the lives of others.
I will set the example by keeping myself physically fit and mentally tough. I will strive to sharpen my Sapper skills and the skills of those I support.
SAPPERS LEAD THE WAY!
